# About the project
***
Based on the quick-parcel-project repository used by the youtuber Benjamain Code during his videos, I decided to design my own version of this starter kit to save time in the development of a project.

I made the choice to replace Parcel by Vite which I find much more advantageous.

This template will be used for "small" orders, as a freelancer, which do not require the use of a framework.

# Installation
